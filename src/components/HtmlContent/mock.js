<p><strong>What does calling useState do?</strong> It declares a “state variable”. Our variable is called count but we could
 call it anything else, like banana. This is a way to “preserve” some values between the function calls — useState is a new 
 way to use the exact same capabilities that this.state provides in a class. Normally, variables “disappear” when the function
  exits but state variables are preserved by React.</p>
